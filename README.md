## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work here Victoria. Your Purpose, Audience, Goals, Persona and Use Case are all well defined. This will give you a solid direction upon which to begin your design process. I'm interested in seeing your ideas for displaying your work - a gallery maybe? Your directory structure is perfect, and your HTML looks great! There were just a couple of very minor notes I made regarding your code - see Edits &amp; Suggestions below. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Nice job.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Don't forget to include the `alt` attribute on all images, and the `src` path needs to be placed in double quotes. (see line 26)
- This is super minor - but in your .gitignore, add a '/' before `.idea`.
