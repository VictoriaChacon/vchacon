		<!--Content Strategy Begins Here-->
		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Home Page</strong>: I want this to feature some artwork of mine, im thinking for now a photo. This will then prompt the user to scroll down the page...I want this to be a single scroll page. </li>
		<br>
			<li><strong>About Me Page</strong>: I want this page to summarize my accomplishments and work. This would be my artist statement. I would let users know my style and what my thought processes are like when I work. </li>
		<br>
			<li><strong>Portfolio</strong>: I want this to be an image gallery on the left, and when you click on an image I would like it to show a description on the right stating the name of the project and a what I used to create the projects, back-story of the project, etc. I will probably only have about 4 pieces of work here for now. This will expand as my web/design career expands.</li>
		<br>
			<li><strong>Contact Page</strong>:This page will forward to my gmail through the webpage. I will have my contact through email, as my workload increases I will have a Facebook for my brand. For now I will limit it to email.</li>
