		<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: My personal website will be a portfolio site. What will this accomplish? This will shoe off my work both past and present. I want to use this site in order to promote my skills in the community as well as give employers a look into what I can do for them.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Audience</strong>: I would like this to be mainy for employers to look at. I am also wanting this to be available to the public who have an interest in design or just as artistic inspiration.</p>
